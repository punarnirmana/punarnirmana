This is an analysis of your Chakra System accessed via the Akashic Records. It gives one an incredibly overview of what you are focused on and may be neglecting, and any imbalances thus created in your life.

**What are Chakras?**

When you look at the very definition of a chakra, it is a spinning disk or a wheel. Essentially, a chakra is known to be a spinning disk on the human body that churns energy through it.

The 7 chakras run along the length of your spine, starting at the “root” chakra at the base of your spine, all the way to your “crown” chakra at the top of the head. These chakras are directly associated with the health of the physical body, mind, and emotions of a person.

**What Do Chakras Do?**

Expanding on the idea of chakras being spinning lights of energy over primary areas on the body, you can then grow to realize that each one has a unique purpose directly associated with the wellbeing of the body. Essentially, they govern the way we psychologically experience life when we are affected by mental and emotional stimuli. Each spinning disc contributes to our overall wellbeing, and we can directly experience what our chakra experiences, whether it is open, closed, balanced or unbalanced, active or inactive, so on and so forth.

When you release any blockages within’ the chakra and balance them so that they work in healthy flow, you give yourself the ability to flow easily through a healthy, enlightened and balanced existence. The balance within’ our chakras directly correlates with the balance in our personal lives, physically, mentally and emotionally. Working with them can assist you in eliminating many unwanted ailments you may be suffering from.

Each chakra is located in a different spot along your spine and serves a different purpose. They also affect different organs and correlate with different ailments. Each one has its own color. They also directly relate to their own set of emotions, feelings, and behaviors. Each one can be worked on to heal the ailments that directly associate with it, once you realize which one is unbalanced or out of alignment. The chakras are a very sophisticated map of the energy body and directly affect our physical, mental and emotional bodies as well.
